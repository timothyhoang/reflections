reflections
===========

There is not much to reflect on this week, I am just trying to update my code and document it so that it is in a 
reproducible state that we can present at the data science fair. This last week has felt somewhat hectic, however
I am glad that there are several google docs to reference and at this point I am going through to make sure that 
all of the code that I wrote runs properly if I were to run it from someone else's computer. I am listing all of
the dependencies that are required to run my code and overall documenting my process.
