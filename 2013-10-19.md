=============

The topics that were challenging this week were mainly conceptual regarding some statistical methods discussed in 
the presentation on Thursday. Working on the second assignment was more clear because we were given some time to review
code that other groups had created for data curation. The assignment for this week was more manageable because we were
able to look over some code and discuss what it did on Tuesday, which made the expectations for the assignment much
clearer. Some of the concepts that were challenging included the Gutberg Richter law for magnitudes, which I had not seen
before the presentation, and Omori-Utsu law for aftershocks and how these laws are applied to predict earthquakes 
likelihood. It is nice that the slides were poste online, because I simply went over the slides and looked up these
concepts on wikipedia, which had more elaborate explanations that helped me understand that the rate of aftershocks with
respect to time follows Omori's Law.

For the project, I am approaching visualization from a more repoducible standpoint in that this week, we had talked about
removing smelly code, namely eliminating the use of magic numbers and having more generalized functions that the average
person could understand. In addition, our group had learned from our mistakes from the previous project and are working
well collaboratively. We had created an irc channel and clarified our roles in the group so that we can try working in 
parallel this time, however, we are having issues figuring out how to deal with JSON since none of us have had any experience
with this format before. Trying to find examples and documentations online is not too difficult, but many of the explanations
that I have found on Stack Overflow are not very helpful to people who have had no experience working with JSON.

It would be nice to have more coding examples like the one we covered in class on Tuesday this week and to go over some
of the differences between languages like Python and R because it makes understanding how to code in languages that you
are not as familiar in more clear.
