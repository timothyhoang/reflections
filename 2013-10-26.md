=============

This week I looked over the visualization code written by other groups, namely groups 11 and 2 to see how they
approached visualization for the recent quakes data. I especially liked how group 11 implemented a heatmap for depth
and subsetted their data to plot for both magnitude and depth. It was helpful to know on Tuesday that we could use 
each others code so long as we asked each other for permission and cited where we got the code from. I think this
encourages much more collaboration and can foster greater productivity, especially for groupos like mine where we are
not really comfortable programming with Python and run into syntax errors more than any kind of conceptual errors in
code. Being able to glance over how other groups write their code help us see how other groups used their data 
structures, which is a lot more helpful than sifting through documentation for those data structures and attempting to 
apply the simplified examples provided in a more complex problem.

Tuesdays lecture was very helpful when we got to look at code from other groups and talked about what to avoid
when writing clean and repoducible code. When trying to repoduce results from other groups' code, it was interesting
to see that many groups ran into the same problems with writing clean and reproducible code, though many groups had
improved from last week by documenting their process and their code. This problem is understandable, however, because 
when we met up in horizontal groups on Thursday, we took a poll and determined that over half of the visualizers had 
not used Python before this class and are not used to the syntax and data structures.

Thursdays lecture was not as helpful, because I think information about grading should be given to students at the
beginning of the semester so they know what to expect from the class. I think most people in the class don't really 
know what kind of grade they currently because it has never been very clear exactly what we are being graded on. In
addition, I do not think that we understand what exactly we are working towards in the final product. Going over the
different parts of the papaer was helpful, but I do not think that I have to technical knowledge to complete some
parts of the final project from going over the concepts in Philip Stark's most recent lecture. I would have to go over
how to mine data
