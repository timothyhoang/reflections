reflections
=============

I am glad this week we finally got to get our hands dirty and worked in groups on a project that invloved using the 
tools we had downloaded in the previous weeks. There were many lessons that we learned about the roadblocks in trying 
to produce reproducable code and data, and we were able to pick up these ideas much faster simply trying to get 
everyone in our vertical groups to get together to put together our presentation than talking about it abstractly. 

The major issue that we had was trying to get an idea of what we needed to do. The constraint of having to use ipython 
to do the data cleaning was tedious because we had to spend a good amount of time simply reading documentation on objects
that we could use, which packages to download, and and proper syntax regarding regular expressions for our code. Since our
group was not familiar with ipython, we had to spend a good amount of time into curating the data, which made it such that
we all had to work on data curation to some extent in trying to figure out how to parse the data in python. To remedy this,
in the future, I think it would be prudent to have everyone learn how to do data curation in python at the same time in
class. That way, everyone is on the same page and people later up in the vertical chain can help out more efficiently and 
there can be some bleeding between the roles where there may be some overlap:

What I mean by this is that for the data curator, their job bleeds over with that of the analyzer and visualizer when it 
comes to cleaning the data, because the curator should pick data that is useful for analysis to clean and the analyzer 
should be cognizant of the type of analysis that they are doing and how it can be presented graphically.

The most difficult part of this week was probably the ambiguity of the guidelines to follow. While the instructions were 
detailed, it felt like we were being thrown into an ocean where many of us would inevitably drown trying to figure out 
what to do, which seems to be the purpose of this exercise, to fail early and often, and learn how to figure out what to do
on our own.

Some recommendations for the future would be to include include dumbed down resources and tutorials, and perhaps a skeleton
of the code so we at least have an idea of what we should do.
