reflections
===========

This week seemed slower than last week. It did not seem as if we had accomplished as much this week as we had last week, 
however, we were able to get a good idea of where we are moving on from this point in time because of the timelines that 
every group had to fill out. I think that the individual surveys were a good idea because it gave people some time to 
reflect on how much they were contributing to the class. For the people who were not contributing much, I think that the 
survey will give them at least some incentive to increase their activity in the class and to try and pick up some of the 
open tasks that are going to be posted (have they been posted?).

Tuesday's class seemed more productive that Thursday's class for several reasons. On Tuesday, we had an Earthquake
presentation that hopefully gave everyone a basic understanding of some of the technical details about earthquakes that
might be useful in developing parameters for analysis in addition to a presentation given by Carl on what we were going
to do from that point in time. Although only some people were paying attention, the presentations had introduced 
some structure into class for the day. After the presentation, we broke up into groups to figure what we
were going to do for Thursday and to coordinate with other groups to determine what we needed from each other.
