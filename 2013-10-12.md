=============

I encoutered a lot of roadblocks this week working in my vertical group trying to complete the assignment for Tuesday.
It was a good learning experience being presented with a seemingly insurmountable problem, where everyone in the group
was unprepared to approach completing the task because we all had very limited experience with regular expressions in 
python. We initially had wanted to create one script in python that could run and present everything that we had wanted 
it to, but as we later learned during the week, perfection was our enemy, as we ran into too many errors trying to get 
the code to compile on each person's machines. It felt like an impossible task to learn how to code in python and get 
everything to work, especially knowing how to use python packages such as gspread and matplotlib in the time that we
were given, but we had an "Aha!" moment late when we realized that our process simply had to be reproducible instead of
perfect.

We failed early and often, but tried to hard to return to python and create a single script instead of splitting our 
process up into multiple parts where we could work in languages that we knew better such as R and simply providing good
documentation. In addition, we had a mixup of roles which we realized late when our analyzer was doing data cleaning 
instead of analysis. In the future, we are making it a goal to meet up earlier to break our parts down and get a general 
idea of our final product.
