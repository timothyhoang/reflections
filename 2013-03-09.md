reflections
===========

The topics that have been challenging this week have included understanding how to access ipython on my 
browser using vagrant instead of virtual box. I had initially thought that I had got ipython notebook to work
using virtual box, however, none of the new notebook documents that I was creating were being saved. The focus 
this weeks seems to be student's interests in reproducible data and why they were taking this class. There 
were a few students who had experience working on projects that utilized reproducibility, however, the majority
of the students in the class seemed to not have any idea what they could do with reproducible data. Many students
had joined this class to learn more about the tools that would be used in data science, such as github and ipython
notebook, however, the discussion on Thursday was engaging in that it was one of the first times we were going 
over the purpose for everything that we were doing: downloading virtual box, using github, using ipython notebook.
I had realized during the discussion that repoducibility had many more real world applications beyond the basic
concepts we had discussed before about reproducible designs for experiments. The short lecture about the mass 
buyout of Intel chips used in Boeing planes and the applications of reproducibility and consistency in plane 
hardware maintenace helped make reproducibility seem more relevant to industry as oppossed to simply science.
