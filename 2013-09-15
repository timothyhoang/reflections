reflections
===========

1.  The topics that have been challenging this week included understanding how to use ipython notebook
and learning about the features that are offered for cross language development and presentation. In
addition, learning how to incorporate Latex in ipython notebook in addition to learning how to use Latex.

2. I had an "Aha!" moment while trying to figure out how to see what my latek code looked like by using a
tek -> pdf converter, however I realized from looking around on forums and google, that there was a program
called TexStudio that I could use to view my latek code and how it looks side by side.

3. If I could start over this week, I would have tried to have been more organized about how I approached
learning Latex. At first, I tried just jumping in and coding using a cheat sheet, however, I encountered many
bugs and formatting errors. I feel like I wasted a lot of time debugging and could have started with simple
tutorials.
