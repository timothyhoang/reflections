===========
On Tuesday, I had sat in a conference call with Brad Luen and several other students. Luen explained both the ETAS and MDA 
models that he had worked with and gave us a vague idea of how to beat ETAS by incorporating more parameters than he had 
in his MDA model. I think it was important that he explained that his MDA model did not beat the ETAS model and that he 
thinks that geo-spacial information can help us improve the performace of our MDA model. We tried to figure out how to set
up the MDA model with constraints to optimize, but could not get an explicit answer because the error functions are generated
from a program that is not a function. I am having trouble figuring out how the error diagrams are generated from the 
conditional intensity of the ETAS and MDA models, which Luen says output tau and nu, where tau = timer length  and nu = proportion 
of earthquakes we are allowed to miss. Luen said that to find tau, we evaluate the conditional intensity on a grid of times
and to find nu, we evaluate the conditional intensity on a grid of evaluation times. While I understand that the error curve
is a funtion of the conditional intensity, I will have to look more into the code to see how exactly it is generated.

Aside from explaining the two models, Luen talked about two different versions of ETAS to consider: temporal and space-time
ETAS and how space-time does only slightly better than temporal ETAS. From here I want to talk more with Disi about creating
a piecewise function that we can optimize for lambda of tau and lambda of nu.

On Thursday, we met up in our groups to talk about what we wanted to accomplish for next week. For my group (#), since we are 
done with the geo-spacial visualization, our group is splitting up to help other groups. Currently I am trying to work with
Disi to see if his group needs any help with the analysis but I am also interested in working with Ashley and Raymond on 
learning D3 to try and make interactive visuals for the final product. Aside from this, in my other group (C), we will try
and condense everything we learned in the conference call with Luen into a PDF that everyone can read to get caught up on what
we had talked about.

Thursday's lecture did not seem to be as productive as Tuesday's and at least for our group, because we had already figured
out what we needed to do for next Tuesday and doing it required my computer at home. In addition, not as many people showed
up this week as they had last week, which makes communication between groups more difficult because I feel that even though
we can communicate online through the issue tracker, we can solve problems much quicker in person. If you are working with 
people from other groups and they don't show up, it is harder to get work done since at this point, the groups are dependent
on each other's knowledge since we do not have enough time to learn everything on our own and groups have specialized to their
roles.

The semester is winding down and we still have much to accomplish. I worry that we may not have enough time to push for a final
product that is successful in beating ETAS since most people have final projects due within the next couple of weeks and finals
are coming up.
