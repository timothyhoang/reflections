=============

It is nice that we are taking the first step into tackling this major project by determining what exactly we have to do
and moving from a state of worry and confusion to a state of questions and ambiguity by breaking into horizontal groups to
determine smaller subsets of problems that we approach with SMART goals. I think it is a good idea that on Tuesday, we 
got everybody on the same page by having our horizontal groups identify questions that we could address. It was helpful,
however, my main concern is that in our visualizer horizontal, there are maybe only about five people out of twelve of us
contributing to the discussion and so it is hard to gauge whether the quesitons we came up with encompass the issues of
the group. 

On Thursday, we began class by breaking off again into horizontal groups and determining SMART goals that subgroups of
our horizontal group can solve. It seemed to be the general consensus that the major roadblock we needed to address from
working in our verticals was how we could parallelize our work such that we were not waiting on the analyzers for their
output. We understood that we could start working and simply tell the analyzers the specific output that we needed, but
we encountered problems before where the analyzers in our individual verticals could not meet the demands for a specific
data type. To address this, we created several SMART goals that we could split between our group members:
- data format for inputs
- understanding the models
- making graphs dynamic
- figuring out what type of graph would be best (easier to understand, representative of the data)
- facilitate comparisons between models
- communicate with curators and analyzers; know what data to expect
- decide how we want the data formatted and negotiate with DC and analyzers
- plotting/visualizing errors and implementing
The roadblock that we encountered here is that we don't really know how to divide the tasks up between the verticals created
out of our horizontal group because some of the goals require other goals to have been completed first, such as understanding
the type of analysis being done and the most effective way to visualize the output from the analyzers before we can form the
kind of input that we need. Forming new verticals from our horizontal seems to be effective in creating groups with more 
focused goals and final products that don't overlap as much with other vertical groups.

This Saturday, I met up with my vertical group and we had dim sum to bond, which was nice because after lunch we were able
to work much more effectively being comfortable with each other. We compiled a list of SMART goals for every job to get a 
better overall picture of what we need to do specifically as a vertical. We are currently working on finishing data curation
so that we can start picking a specific input for visualization.
