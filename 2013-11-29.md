reflections
===========

I thought the presentation given by Fernando Pérez on Tuesday was interesting, but not really applicable to what we need 
to accomplish at this point in the semester. It was interesting to learn about the usefulness of IPython Notebook and its
many features, especially being able to embed R code within the IPython Notebook, but I failed to understand the relevance
of the talk in order to make progress with our current struggle with beating ETAS in the analysis. The presentation that 
preceded Pérez's was much more informative in getting us on the same page about the current progress the analyzers are making.
This week I am getting up to date with Disi and revising my code in addition to documenting it since the checking group
wanted to take a look.
