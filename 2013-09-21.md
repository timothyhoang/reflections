reflections
=============

1. The topics that were challending this week were mainly conceptual, as I am taking this class 
concurrently with stat 157, I was unable to follow some of the statistical concepts introduced 
on Thursday in Philip Stark's presentation involving the cortical mass of different mice populations,
namely how he was differentiating between natural perturbations of cortical mass between different
groups of rats based on genetics and the affect of the drug.

2. I had an "Aha!" moment this week when I used ipython notebook and coded some python code for my lab
job using pyserial and cgkit python packages to create a hand movement task for a motor learning expirement.

3. If I had started this week over I would have taken more extensive notes during the Philip Stark's
presentation instead of trying to understand what he was trying to explain because it would be nice to
look up specifically the concepts that were difficult to understand and learn them on my own.
