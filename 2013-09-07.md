===========

1.  The topics that have been challenging this week included understanding how to use github's 
features and how it works compared to other version control systems, in addition to understanding 
the concepts behind access control and branch handling. In addition to this, another challende was
installing ubuntu server on virtualbox, as the instructions were relatively minimal and I had to 
do a lot of reading on the side to figure out how to get the virtual machine to run properly because
I built my computer with a newer motherboard and it took a while to figure out how to configure my 
BIOS to run with virtual hardware.

2. I had an "Aha!" moment while trying to figure out how to install ubuntu server on virtualbox. 
Initially, I tried installing the server with memory settings that I chose myself, because I had
thought that the part of the instructions which referred to accepting all defaults was referring to
the defaults of ubuntu server 13.04 instead of the defaults in setting up the virtual machine. Once
I did this I was able to get the virtual machine running (instead of just a black screen). Before
this moment, I was frustrated because the instructions were vague, but once I started googling about
some of the issues I encountered with setting up the virtual machine, I was able to learn a lot from
reading forum threads and tutorials. Some people had encountered the same problems I had, and reading
through various forum threads helped me figure out what the problem was with setting up a virtual
machine and enabling various features of my motherboard.

3. If I could start over this week, I would have tried to contact people in the class earlier to see
if anyone was having the same problems that I was having. Initially, I did not think that many people 
were encountering problems, so I figured I would just ask my friend the next day, however, I realized
that the majority of the class were running into the same problems I had because the instructions were
intentionally left to be ambiguous so that we could fill them out on our own.
